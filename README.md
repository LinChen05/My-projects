# My projects
The following projects were created for my grade 12 classes, where we were able to create our own projects for every assignments.
As of now all of these projects are programmed in Processing, but in the future other projects that incoperates Python and C in the future will be included.

## Cracking Simulation

### Cracking: Purpose
Cracking simulation as the name suggest is a simulation of cracks being formed. It also includes a thunder simulation as well. On top of the simulation, there are also customization for the effects as well. This was my most ambitious project, as I was inspired by the patterns that snow produces, and so this was probably my second favourite project behind the road simulation project.


## Formeo

Picture of the formation GUI, the music player, the formation display, and how the formations are being stored for later uses.

### Formeo: Purpose
Formeo was a group project that my classmates and I made. The purpose of Formeo is to be able to sync formations of a dance to song. Essentailly being a choreography planner. What makes it unique is that the formations can be saved on an automatically generated file, and can be used again. 

### Formeo: My Contributions
While my teammates were the ones who helped create the GUI and the dancers movements, I created saving and music playing features of the program. I had to teach myself how to use the text reading and creating functions, how to play music, and how to import user music files into the program in processing.

## Road Simulation

A simulation of a road with intersections with the red cubes representing cars.

### Road: Purpose
This simulation is a simple recreation of cars travelling intersections in a grid patterned road. The cars are able to stop or go dependig on the light, and able to stop before it hits a car in front of it. This is one of my personal favourite project as it had a simple idea, but the programming behind it took me a while to figure out.

### Road: Function
The simulation mainly relies on managing an array of cars, and checking if the position of the cars matches the road, and the condition of the traffic lights.
